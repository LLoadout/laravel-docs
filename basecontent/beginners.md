# Welcome

This book is automatically created from the markdown files of the official Laravel Documentation ( laravel/docs ).  
This first book gives you a base overview of what Laravel is and what the base concepts of Laravel are.

The second book Laravel-advanced ( in progress ) will be the more advanced part of the documentation and is for more advanced usage.
